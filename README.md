# Engineering project

The repository presents a matlab project that was created to generate point clouds from a sequence of images.   
This project was used by me in my engineering thesis for research and experiments.

## About the thesis

Generating point clouds based on image sequences

The purpose of this thesis was to generate a point cloud, based on two images representing the human hand.    
This thesis contains a description of the method used to extract and match so-called feature points, 
derivation of the formulas for the transformation matrix, camera models and triangulation, 
a detailed description of the proposed solution and a series of experiments.
